# Pixel Art Maker Project

#This project helped me understand DOM manipulation using jQuery and javaScript. Here you will learn how to link the jQuery library to the HTML file. For my case i downloaded the library and used it locally in the computer. This is meant to help in off-line coding. you will see how jQuery can be used to manipulate the color of different HTML elements and also creation of tables according to the value of input by the user. ENJOY!


To get started, I opened `designs.js` and started building out the app's functionality.

The specific instructions are contained in the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
